To build the python shell, first install the following:
    $ sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev python3-cmd2 python3-colorama
Next, update the following lines in the Makefile as appropriate:
    BOOST_PYTHON_LIB = boost_python3
    PYTHON_LIB = python3.6m
    PYTHON_INC_DIR = /usr/include/python3.6m
Then run
    $ make python

Run the shell with this (use "python3 ./pyshell" if needed):
    $ ./pyshell
Type "help" to get help on instructions. Mostly compatible with the C++ shell.

Getting errors while trying to run the python shell?
1) "ImportError: dynamic module does not define init function (initpython_egalito)"
    means you compiled against python 3 but are running with python 2
2) "ImportError: .../python_egalito.so: undefined symbol: _ZN5boost6python..."
    means your boost python library and python library are different versions
3) "ImportError: ...: undefined symbol: PyString_Type"
    means you compiled against python 2 but are running with python 3
