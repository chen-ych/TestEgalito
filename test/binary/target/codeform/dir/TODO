 | TODO list for future versions of codeform |
\*-------------------------------------------*/

Short-term
- ? Optimise rule searching by looking in the previous position first
- Add support for "\n" and "\param" in specific comments ("" and /*! */)
- Make a "function" rule: \w+\s+\(
- ? Don't print closing tags for same-coloured nested comments
- Provide a default rules directory that is searched first
- Make "escaped newline" (\) character specifiable
- Don't count #es in #defines as new comments;
    don't allow nestcoms to include themselves
[done] - Allow multiple prev pointers!
[done] - free static variables in add_rule()

Long-term
- Make input, output and styles rules files separate

Distant long-term
- Support indent-style code beautifying
- Support regular expressions
