\*-----------------------------------*/

A code formatter and colourer [intended] for C and C++.

History
-------

Spending as much time as I do on message boards etc I eventually grew tired of
reading code that wasn't colour-coded. I decided to write a program to colour
code myself. (Not that there weren't programs to do this already, but I wanted
to try it.) The result was codeform.

The first version of codeform I wrote (version 1.00) had all the keywords
hard-coded into the program. It highlighted C keywords (all the same colour),
strings, character quotes, and numbers. From there, I gradually added external
data files, dynamic memory allocation, etc.

Since 1.00 there have been many versions of codeform. See the file HISTORY for
a complete list. (Versions after 1.10 have two periods, such as 1.2.0, in case
of over 10 subversions, such as 1.2.12.)

The file HISTORY also contains a partial list of features for codeform 1.2.0.

Download
--------

Source is included in all distributions, along with executables for Windows
(and usually Linux).

http://dwks.theprogrammingsite.com/myprogs/down/codeform.zip (about 200,000):
    codeform version 1.2.0, including source, Windows and (usually) Linux
    executables.
http://dwks.theprogrammingsite.com/myprogs/down/codeform110.zip (17,744):
    codeform v1.10, including source and Windows executable.

The current official page for codeform is at
http://dwks.theprogrammingsite.com/myprogs/codeform.htm.

Usage
-----

To run codeform under Windows, type "codeform" from the command line. For
Linux, type "./codeform" or the appropriate directory (or, if it's in your
path, just "codeform").

To get help on codeform's usage directly from the command line, use the
--usage argument. (Versions 1.00 - 1.10 used different arguments.)

----
$ ./codeform --usage

codeform version 1.2.0 by DWK
Executable path: ./codeform

usage: codeform [-f rule-file] [-e inline-rule] [-o output]
                [--help] [-h] [--usage] [--version] [-v]
                [--] [rule-file-if-no-other-rules] [files...]

The arguments are very similar to sed's (and -o is from GCC).

Output can go to multiple files -- just specify more than one -o argument. With
no -o arguments (or if none of the output files could be opened), stdout is
used instead.

If no rules are specified, the first argument that isn't preceded by an option
is taken as a rules file instead of an input file. With no input files, stdin
is used.

A simple usage of codeform might look like the following:
    $ ./codeform -o codeform.htm rules/c_1_html codeform.c
This formats codeform.c according to the rules in rules/c_1_html, storing the
output in codeform.htm.
$
----

--help, -h, and --usage do the same thing; so do --version and -v.

If you want to colour Dev-C++ style C into inline CSS, use this:
    $ ./codeform -o codeform.htm -f rules/_ilcss -f rules/c_devcpp codeform.c

If you want to emulate cat for some reason, use this:
    $ ./codeform

Files
-----

Here is a description of all of the files in the root of codeform's install
directory. (The files in subdirectories are too numerous to cover here.) Files
or folders marked with an asterisk (*) are covered in the next section.

doc/          * Doxygen-generated technical documentation for the source.
rules/        The highlighting rules files that come with codeform.
codeform      Linux 32-bit executable for codeform.
codeform.c    The only source file for codeform, written in ANSI C89 C.
codeform.exe  Windows 32-bit executable for codeform.
codeform.htm  Codeform formatted into CSS with itself with rules/c_1_css.
COPYING       The license agreement for codeform, the GNU GPL 2.
HISTORY       Features of codeform and descriptions of previous versions.
make.bat      * Batch file that uses passes make Makewin under Windows.
Makefile      * Makefile to compile codeform under Windows.
Makewin       * Makefile to compile codeform under Linux.
README        This readme file.
TODO          * An incomplete todo list.

Technical documentation
-----------------------

Documentation for codeform's source (generated by Doxygen) is available in the
source itself and in the doc/ subdirectory. A how-to for writing and
interpreting rules file is located in rules/HOWTO.txt.

Codeform is written in ANSI C89-compatible C. A makefile is included,
Makefile, to compile codeform for Linux with gcc. make.bat uses Makewin to
compile for Windows using gcc as well (rm is assumed to exist for the clean
target). Since codeform is an ANSI compatible program, however, you should
have no problems compiling it on any platform with or without the makefiles.

There is an incomplete todo list in the file TODO. There is much more that I
would like to do with codeform than the list would indicate.
