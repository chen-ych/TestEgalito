History of codeform:

---- versions 1.2.x:

1.2.0 [ongoing]:
    Complete re-write of codeform. Features include:
        - Much faster than codeform 1.10 (about five times faster)
        - Binary search for rules making it much faster for many rules
        - Sequential keywords of the same colour have one tag
        - Unlimited line length for rules and input files
        - Support for multiple input, output, and rules files
        - Inline rules which can be specified on the command line
        - Greatly improved data files which support variables and part sharing
        - Automatic termination of strings that don't terminate
        - Support for comments inside comments (ie, /**/ inside #)
        - Much more generic and easier to extend (few hard-coded assumptions)
        - Comments in the code so it's pretty much readable
        - No memory leaks (according to Valgrind with rules/c_1_css)

---- versions 1.00 - 1.10:

1.11 [codeform.c]:
    Version 1.2.0 was started instead.

1.10 [codeform_208.c]:
    Removed [newline] header, added [backslash]. Changed
    data_syntax_error(). Fixed search-and-replace.

1.09 [codeform_192.c]:
    Eliminated [surround] in dat file; made it more flexible.

1.08 [codeform_181.c]:
    Reduced memory consumption in read_data() (by ~3000B).
    Added allocate_defaults(), so that a blank file can be
    used for a dat file.

1.07 [codeform_143.c]:
    Incorporated dynamic memory allocation into the dat file
    reading code (read_data() and others).

1.06 [codeform_121.c]:
    Changed data definitions to make the code much faster
    (10 vars -> 1 array (idata)).

1.04 [codeform_81.c] - 1.05 [codeform_100.c]:
    Improved the memory consumption immensely: converted
    hard-coded data into dat file (executable shrank
    from 23KB to 14KB).

1.03 [codeform_59.c]:
    Fixed chomp() to work under *NIX. A bit of modularization.
    Very minor. Posted code on cboard.cprogramming.com.

1.02 [codeform_56.c]:
    Added search - and - replacing, and mlstrings. Fixed some
    bugs. Removed SQUOTE mode (made into string). Lots of
    modularization.

1.01 [codeform_26.c]:
    Not much at all. Modularization and --version.

1.00 [codeform_24.c]:
    Started codeform. Included keywords, s/mlcomments, one
    string type ("hippo"), squotes (different mode), numbers,
    and newlines.
